# Hey, I'm Mark!

My background is primarily in distributed systems / data pipelines / databases, but I've returned to school to do a deep dive into mathematics, networks, and lower-level programming to pivot into Data Science or IoT (any field that combines embedded, science, machine learning, and networks).

While studying, I work as a TA and tutor (Dashboard can be found [here](https://de-mark.github.io/tutoring_dashboard/) if you're interested), as a Biodiversity Analysis intern, as a Machine Learning intern, and as a Software Developer for Astronomy & Physics club.

My current major is: AS in Computer Science, Mathematics, Environmental Science, and Biological Sciences

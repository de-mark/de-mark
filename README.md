# Hey, I'm Mark!

My background is primarily in distributed systems / data pipelines / databases, but I've returned to school to do a deep dive into mathematics, networks, and lower-level programming to get a better handle on things.

While studying, I work as a TA and tutor (Dashboard can be found [here](https://de-mark.github.io/tutoring_dashboard/) if you're interested.

# Hey, I'm Mark!

I'm a data science and machine learning student whose goal is to learn how to make efficient, ethical, and environmentally sustainable AI and automative solutions.

My major is Computer Science (with a focus in artificial intelligence and machine learning), but I'm also working on Associates in mathematics, environmental studies, biological sciences, and GIS to ensure that I'm able to understand my field on a deeper level!

I worked as a data analytics / full stack engineering TA / tutor from 2020-2024, so if you're a former student, feel free to say hi!
